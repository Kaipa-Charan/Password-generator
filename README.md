# Password-generator

This code defines a function generate_password that takes an optional argument length (default 12) specifying the length of the generated password. The function uses the secrets.choice function to randomly select characters from a string of letters, digits, and punctuation.

You can customize the alphabet string to include or exclude specific types of characters, depending on your password requirements.

To generate a password, simply call the generate_password function and store the result in a variable. The example code above then prints the generated password to the console.
